1. Mobile App (React Native + Expo) – [1.5–2 hrs]
   Task:
   Build a simple mobile app with:
   • Login screen (email/password)
   • To-Do list screen (create, view, delete tasks)
   • Consume GraphQL API (hosted separately)
   Focus Areas:
   • UI/UX basics
   • API integration via GraphQL
   • React Navigation usage
   Bonus:
   • Offline support or local state cache

2. Backend (Node.js + GraphQL) – [1.5 hrs]
   Task:
   Create a minimal GraphQL server that:
   • Supports user login/signup (with dummy auth)
   • CRUD for to-do items (user-scoped)
   Stack Hints:
   • Use Apollo Server
   • Store data in-memory or simple file-based persistence (e.g., lowdb)

3. Web App (React + Vercel) – [1–1.5 hrs]
   Task:
   Create a simple React web app:
   • Same features as mobile: login and to-do list
   • Deploy on Vercel and submit live link
   Bonus:
   • Use a component library (e.g., Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS)

• Responsive design

4. Cloud (AWS) – [1 hr]
   Task:
   • Deploy the GraphQL backend to AWS Lambda or EC2
   • Or alternatively, write a short deployment plan (architecture, services, cost estimate)
