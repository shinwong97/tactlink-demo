# Architecture Decisions Record (ADR)

## Overview

This document records the key architectural decisions made during the development of the TactLink full-stack todo application. Each decision is documented with its context, considered alternatives, and rationale.

## ADR-001: TypeScript Across All Layers

**Context**: Need for type safety and better developer experience across the entire stack.

**Decision**: Use TypeScript for backend, web frontend, and mobile app development.

**Rationale**:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and error detection
- **Shared Types**: Ability to share type definitions between frontend and backend
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and refactor large codebases
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear contracts and interfaces between components

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Reduced runtime errors
- ✅ Better developer productivity
- ✅ Improved code maintainability
- ⚠️ Additional build step required
- ⚠️ Learning curve for TypeScript

## ADR-002: React with Vite for Web Frontend

**Context**: Need for a modern, fast web development environment.

**Decision**: Use React with Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: Vite provides extremely fast hot module replacement and build times
- **Modern Tooling**: Uses native ES modules for development
- **React Ecosystem**: Excellent React support with JSX and TypeScript
- **Developer Experience**: Fast refresh and instant server start
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized production builds with tree-shaking

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Extremely fast development server startup
- ✅ Instant hot module replacement
- ✅ Optimized production builds
- ✅ Modern development experience
- ⚠️ Requires Node.js 14+ for development

## ADR-003: React Native with Expo for Mobile

**Context**: Need for cross-platform mobile development with rapid iteration.

**Decision**: Use React Native with Expo for mobile application development.

**Rationale**:

- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for both iOS and Android
- **Expo Ecosystem**: Excellent developer tools, over-the-air updates, and managed services
- **React Knowledge**: Leverages existing React knowledge and patterns
- **Rapid Development**: Hot reloading and instant preview capabilities
- **Managed Workflow**: Handles complex native build configurations

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Single codebase for iOS and Android
- ✅ Excellent developer experience with Expo tools
- ✅ Over-the-air updates capability
- ✅ Managed native dependencies
- ⚠️ Bundle size limitations with Expo Go
- ⚠️ Some native modules require custom development builds

---

## ADR-004: Context API for State Management

**Context**: Need for simple, lightweight state management across the application.

**Decision**: Use React Context API for authentication and global state management.

**Rationale**:

- **Built-in**: No additional dependencies required
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Performance**: Sufficient for the current application scale
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal learning curve for new developers

**Consequences**:

- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ✅ Built into React
- ⚠️ Potential performance issues with large state trees
- ⚠️ No built-in dev tools for debugging

**Future Considerations**: Consider Redux Toolkit or Zustand if the application grows in complexity.

## ADR-005: JWT for Authentication

**Context**: Need for stateless authentication that works across web and mobile clients.

**Decision**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with Bearer token strategy.

**Rationale**:

- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across web and mobile
- **Scalability**: No shared session storage needed for horizontal scaling
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and debug
- **Security**: Can include user claims and expiration

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Stateless authentication
- ✅ Works across all platforms
- ✅ No server-side session storage
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ⚠️ Token size (larger than session IDs)
- ⚠️ No built-in revocation mechanism
- ⚠️ Security considerations for token storage

---

## ADR-006: Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Context**: Need for rapid UI development with consistent design system.

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for web application styling.

**Rationale**:

- **Utility-First**: Rapid development with utility classes
- **Consistency**: Built-in design system and spacing scale
- **Performance**: PurgeCSS integration removes unused styles
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive design utilities
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IntelliSense and documentation

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Rapid UI development
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Small bundle size in production
- ✅ Excellent responsive design support
- ⚠️ Learning curve for utility-first approach
- ⚠️ HTML can become verbose with many classes

---

## ADR-007: React Native Paper for Mobile UI

**Context**: Need for consistent, Material Design-based UI components for mobile.

**Decision**: Use React Native Paper for mobile application UI components.

**Rationale**:

- **Material Design**: Follows Google's Material Design guidelines
- **Expo Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Expo managed workflow
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Component Library**: Rich set of pre-built components
- **Customization**: Easy to customize themes and components

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Consistent Material Design UI
- ✅ Rich component library
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript support
- ✅ Easy theming and customization
- ⚠️ Material Design constraints
- ⚠️ Bundle size increase

---

## ADR-008: Monorepo Structure

**Context**: Need to manage multiple related applications (backend, web, mobile) efficiently.

**Decision**: Organize the project as a monorepo with separate directories for each application.

**Rationale**:

- **Code Sharing**: Easy to share types, utilities, and configurations
- **Version Control**: Single repository for all related code
- **Development Workflow**: Easier to coordinate changes across applications
- **Documentation**: Centralized documentation and setup instructions
- **Deployment**: Simplified CI/CD pipeline management

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Easy code sharing between applications
- ✅ Single source of truth for the entire project
- ✅ Simplified development workflow
- ✅ Centralized documentation
- ⚠️ Repository size grows with all applications
- ⚠️ Need for clear directory structure and conventions
